# Revit External Events
This is a tutorial repository which shows how the Revit External Events work in a very fundemantal scenario. Especially for the beginners, it could be very hard to grasp the concept of External Events. That's why I wanted write a very simple plugin, based on the examples from RevitSDK, which exposes the basic functionality without complex workflows like wrappers, abstract objects.
